## What is [OptiFine](https://www.optifine.net/home) & [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium)?

<details>
OptiFine is a very popular optimization mod that helps improve Minecraft's performance, and adds extra features that the vanilla client doesn't have. However, even while being a
performance mod, it's still very sluggish.

* E.G. Booting up the game or even changing resource packs takes foreverrrrrr...

Furthermore, the closed-source nature and intrusive characteristics of OptiFine pose challenges for other developers aiming to produce mods that are compatible with it.

Sodium is the free & open-source alternative to OptiFine that actually has **better performance**, and is compatible with a wide range of the Fabric mod ecosystem.
However, by itself, it lacks many of the beloved features from OptiFine, such as a zoom key, shader support, dynamic lighting, extreme customization with resource packs, etc.,
which can make transitioning out of OptiFine very difficult.
</details>

## So What Does This Modpack Do?

By using [the following mods](#mod-list), we're able to incorporate ALL of OptiFine's features, while still using Sodium! In addition, there are many quality of life
features & changes that improves the ENTIRE Minecraft experience. However still, the goal of this modpack is to stay as close as possible to "vanilla OptiFine." Hence,
there's no need to worry about mods that add content or change core game mechanics (as those are not included). We're just cloning the OptiFine experience, but
making it better!

* The mods in this modpack are categorized into [Performance](#performance), [OptiFine Features](#optifine-features), [Utility](#utility), [Extra Features](#extra-features),
  and [Libraries](#libraries).
* There are [Optional Mods](#optional) included in each release, and you can pick and choose which one you'd like to use.

#### Quick Note

This modpack is actually the personal modpack I use, and I thought it'd be a good idea to share it properly on GitHub so everybody else can use it! (It also makes it easier
for me to force it down my friends' throats 😅). Hope you guys enjoy it.

## How to Install & Use

`This is for the Vanilla Minecraft Launcher`

1. [Download Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/) & install the Minecraft version you'd like to use.
2. [Download NANO](https://github.com/SirDanielIII/NANO/releases/). **Make sure the version you install corresponds with the correct Minecraft version!**
3. Unzip the file. (If you don't know how to do this... please Google it).
4. Locate the folder that Minecraft resides in, and go into the `mods` folder.
    * If there's no `mods` folder, just create it in the Minecraft directory.
    * If you need help locating the Minecraft folder, see [Windows](#windows) & [macOS](#macos).
5. **DELETE ANY PREVIOUS MODS CURRENTLY IN THE `mods` FOLDER, OR MOVE THEM INTO A FOLDER INSIDE SO THEY'RE OUT OF THE WAY.**
6. Copy & paste the JARs from the NANO folder into mods
    * Make sure the JARs are sitting in `mods` and not a folder inside `mods`!
    * Don't forget to copy-paste any JARs from NANO's "Optional" folder as well!
    * Ignore the following folders if they're present: `autotip` `memory_repo`
7. Open the Minecraft Launcher
8. Select the Fabric profile you want to run (E.G. fabric-loader-1.19.4) and press play!
    * [Optional] You can give your Minecraft profile more RAM. To do this, find the profile you want to edit in the "Installations" tab. Then click on the three dots to the right,
      then edit. Finally, change the number in `Xmx2G` to something like `Xmx6G` if you'd like to give Minecraft 6GB of RAM.
9. If Minecraft launches, and you get this message, just continue and ignore it:
